Android Studio Developed UI

This app was created using Android studio and had no actual bluetooth functionality in the end but the UI worked on any android device. It is dynamic for any type of screen.

The only files that I used to create this were the activity_fullscreen.xml and the AndroidManifest.xml because Android Studio helps create a lot of it in the beginning.
